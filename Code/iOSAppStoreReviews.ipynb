Their bikes are insanely heavy and hard to maneuver. The seats are impossible to adjust. The baskets they have are completely useless so you better not have anything that you need to bring with you. The e bikes are kind of good but same basket issue and you can never find them or their batteries are dead. And then there’s the issue of the docks. It’s feast or famine. They either have completely full docks so you can’t lock up the bike you have or there’s no bikes available. I tried using it as my commute to work but the complete lack of dependability on their end meant I was either going to be late or I had to use different transport. And then it’s only financially feasible if you pay for the year which if you only use it occasionally is not worth it. I don’t understand. I’ve used bike shares in other cities and they are leaps and bounds better than divvy. The bikes actually work, they have decent baskets so if you have a bag to tote it’s not a problem, you can actually find the bikes and there’s plenty of docks. Also, be wary of the e bikes because I had a $15 ride recently that was only 5 miles because I happened to be in a higher COL area. Save your money and buy yourself a bike that actually works, take the el, walk, drive. Don’t use divvy.'},\n",

If there were bikes in the dock when I looked, I’d unlock one with my physical keyfob and ride; if not, I wouldn’t! This app is quite an improvement since then, and I use Divvy much more, being able to plan around availability.  \\n\\nI’m pleased that the odd map scrolling bug in the 14.39.42 update was fixed quickly. That made the app really hard to use.  \\n\\nAs for app problems, there are sometimes little glitches such as an e-bike showing on the map when it’s actually nowhere to be seen, or inaccurate counts of available bikes at a dock. But for the most part it works as it should.  \\n\\nI haven’t noticed very many payment oddities, even since the Lyft buyout. A few times recently the app has had trouble authorizing with Apple Pay, but it clears up after a while, and I’m not sure which party is to blame.

       "  'review': 'Divvy is a bike sharing service to get you from point A to point B. The bikes are slow and heavy because they have to be durable enough to withstand all the idiots out there that abuse them. And speaking of idiots, giving the app one star because it doesn’t have one feature you like such as keeping track of your favorite docks? If you can’t figure out how to find a dock without that, you probably shouldn’t be riding a bike in the city. One star for not adequately tracking the calories you burn? Come on. Buy a Fitbit if you want to know that. The purpose of the app is to help you find an available bike nearby and access it using a code, and it works very well at doing that. It runs off the GPS on your phone, so if the location isn’t accurate, blame your cell service, not the Divvy app. The app is also not responsible for the traffic in Chicago that makes it difficult for you to get around on a bike.  It’s much easier to get around on a bike than a car in many cases, and much cheaper than Uber.',\n",
