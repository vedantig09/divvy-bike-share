      "VISITORS BEWARE! E-bikes cost much more than just $15 for a day pass. Even though the website doesn't tell you this, I had to learn the hard way. Apparently you're supposed to just know this information, or be willing to read the entire website, even though you're from out of town and just looking for a fun way to spend a few hours on a Saturday. The cost is actually $15 for a day pass, PLUS .20 cents PER MILE on an e-bike. Based on reading the webpage, you would think it was only $15 as long as you had the bike checked out for less than 3 hours. That's what the webpage says. But the webpage doesn't tell you the whole truth. Just avoid this altogether. We had a good time riding around the park areas of Chicago, but in hindsight, it wasn't really worth the hassle of feeling taken advantage of by this company.\n",

      "when I returned the bike, it locked as it should, but didn't stop counting the time. I activated the help of the app and after sending many photos and explanations, the person who was attending said that the tour had ended and I would not be charged extra. However, I was charged 100 dollars for a one-hour tour. After a lot of explaining and stress on my part, I ended up wasting part of my short time in Chicago to resolve the issue. They returned part of the money, but still warned that the 100 dollars would be returned within 7 days. 7 days!!\n",

      "The idea of bike sharing is great. I have actually enjoyed having the convenience of the bikes since I don't own a car. But as with most ambitious apps there are a lot of things they did not consider. One of which is the amount of stealing that goes on and abuse of the app. My main concern however is the awful quality of the bikes. The original blue bikes are useless. Most of them are in horrible disrepair and the fact that these bikes get left outside all year round only contributes to that. Then you have the original ebikes, the black ones, which at first were okay but now many of them are unresponsive and also in disrepair. The bikes are very heavy and have absolutely no suspension in the seat or the bike itself. I came to realize that riding them actually aggravates my sciatica. Last year when I was riding the ebikes on a regular basis I ended up with a severe sciatica attack that had me immobilized over a week. I thought the new bikes, the light colored ones were going to be better but they are just as bad as far as the suspension. So if you are young and have no back problems perhaps you will fare well.\n",

      "They introduced fees for electric bikes that used to be free of charge in half of the city (in so-called green zones, areas where there抯 not enough divvy parking spaces). They say they did it because they now have PAID electric scooters (they only offer a slight discount for those who already paid for annual divvy membership), which doesn抰 make any sense. Dear Divvy, if I wanted paid scooters instead of free bikes, I would have gotten myself a different membership!\n",

      "Divvy/Lyft has stolen from me. I抦 getting a huge feeling of scam-like energy happening here: I rented out a bike utilizing the app & used it for less than an hour before returning it, securely. the green light came on and it beeped, which means it抯 LOCKED IN. Two days later, Lyft emails me exclaiming that the bike is considered lost or stolen, and if I do not return to ensure the bike is stationed there(I抦 not from Chicago), I would receive a charge of 1200 dollars on my debit card. I had already been charged twice over 110 dollars (not sure why twice?) because the bike wasn抰 considered returned. .15 cents per minute, which haulted after 24 hours. Another important detail is i opted for using the 15 dollar 24 hour rental option in the app. So why was I charged that much? Ultimately, now I have paid around 450 dollars (they take it automatically) for a bike rental that I used for less than ONE HOUR. Conveniently, they claimed they gave me a deal since my account has been in good standing, and charged me 250 for the missing bike, rather than 1200. There are more details, but it feels too complex now. I am not the one to get on here and write a review like this.. but this sucks bad. I saw at least 5 divvy bikes lying around the bike trail that were abandoned?if i go and collect/ return those, can I at least get my money back? Damn. There needs to be trackers on the bikes, and perhaps cameras at the stations. But again, I locked my bike in securely. I抳e used Divvy for years. Shame.\n",

      "Need more explicit instructions on rental procedures. Downloaded and used the app on my phone to rent bike for three people. Wasn't super user friendly and once we got first bike unlocked, it wouldn't allow us to add any others. Finally gave up and used quiosk for other two bikes and so did my friend who also wanted to rent 3 bikes. She rented hers, but had difficult time because code given didn't unlock black electric bikes, only blue ones. Nothing we saw said anything about difference in renting process nor fees for different bikes. She finally unlocked her 3 and we still had my one and the 30 minutes on that bike was about up, when I got code for two more. Got one out that was blue, but all other bikes at station were black. Tried code for each one and nothing. Only gives you 5 minutes to unlock all bikes you rent too, so was running out of time. Finally called customer service and was told could only do 1 bike from app per account and those were black electric ones. When explained situation about no more blue bikes was told would have to cancel rental and go to another station. Then a man came to add more blue bikes to station and I asked if our code could be reactivated but was told would have to cancel order and do again. Decided to just cancel all bikes so called back customer service. Was about to get charged for 30 minutes from app rental, but I complained enough to get refund. Was told that would take 5 days though. It didn't, but just imagine! Arghhhh! Tried to cancel other two rentals and nothing came up on my account. Was told that as soon as bike is released, card is charged. Customer service questioned my info as if I didn't know my own deets, that by way we're same from app rental that did show up. Finally handed phone to friend to cancel her bikes and then had to ask (not offered) a reference number in case I get charged for the two from quiosk rental. I see so many people riding these, and wonder how many others have had similar struggles. Even as I was on phone, a group came up to do same as us and so we informed them of process so they wouldn't have same issue. But they at least had a full rack of blue bikes, so it wouldn't have been as big a struggle.\n",

      "I have rented this bike at a Station in my Community for errands! The positive is that. I was able to get the things I needed. The negative is that it's not a long distance bike because in my case it's took over 2 hours to finish my errands and return it to the station. This bike does move slow unless you petal hard The price is very right in renting this bike which makes great sense. The only problems are that Supermarkets won't allow the bike inside and worries about it being stolen. I have to watch watch my back every time I ride this bike to make sure nobody knocks me off it. When I returned it there were problems locking it. I had to e-mail the Office to let them know and the fixed it right away! You do have to leave a $25 deposit which takes 2-3 days to get refunded to your bank account! Overall this bike does get you around but in a slower way which is better than riding a Bus with COVID going on! I\"'ll keep using this bike if I have to but it's only good for touring. One thing I do get great exercise riding this bike. I do get a slight workout burn in legs while pushing the petals maybe because I haven't rode a bike in a very long time.\n",

I docked a bike after a 10 minute ride and it was not registered but the bike locked and I couldn抰 get it out to retry. I immediately raised an incident and included pictures of the bike securely docked at the station. 24 hours later and I have not heard a response from their customer service since the incredibly unhelpful initial response to turn app notifications on (what? How does that relate to my issue?) current bike ride time is over 24 hours with no end to this disaster in sight. And every second you have the bike over 30 minutes is an extra charge.\n",

      "Some friends and I were in Chicago for a weekend. We wanted to explore the shore of Lake Michigan so we rented some Divvy bikes for an hour. That was fabulous! We picked them up and road along the lake front and got to see boats coming in and out of port. It was great. When we were done it was a little more challenging finding a place to return the bikes to. I had to download the app and then found a location that had 4 empty spaces. Tip: download the app before you start! They were so easy to ride and really fun with a little bell on them!!!\n",

      "After about a 10/15 minute break (sitting with the bikes) it auto-stopped the ride and charged extra for not stopping the ride at a parking station. No option to extend the ride that I could see when I wasn't done with the bike. Super non-obvious how to finish the ride for a first time user. Expensive to use an E-bike. First time setup was pretty stupid - it made me scan the bike 4 times before it finally let me pay. Don't let people scan until everything is ready!\n",

The e bikes are kind of good but same basket issue and you can never find them or their batteries are dead. And then there鈥檚 the issue of the docks. It鈥檚 feast or famine. They either have completely full docks so you can鈥檛 lock up the bike you have or there鈥檚 no bikes available. I tried using it as my commute to work but the complete lack of dependability on their end meant I was either going to be late or I had to use different transport. And then it鈥檚 only financially feasible if you pay for the year which if you only use it occasionally is not worth it. I don鈥檛 understand. I鈥檝e used bike shares in other cities and they are leaps and bounds better than divvy. The bikes actually work, they have decent baskets so if you have a bag to tote it鈥檚 not a problem, you can actually find the bikes and there鈥檚 plenty of docks. Also, be wary of the e bikes because I had a $15 ride recently that was only 5 miles because I happened to be in a higher COL area.

      "i鈥檝e gone and walked to three different stations to just get a classic bike. there were multiple at each station but no matter what the bikes were 鈥渦navailable鈥? with no reason or ANYTHING. every single station wouldn鈥檛 allow me to get a classic bike. but of course, all the more expensive electric bikes are available. there鈥檚 no good way to contact customer service and im starting to think the classic bikes are unavailable because they鈥檙e trying to get people to use the electric bikes which would thus give divvy more money. upsetting that i鈥檝e walked like thirty minutes to find a CLASSIC BIKE and was unsuccessful. definitely don鈥檛 think i鈥檒l try divvy again after this happening for the millionth time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don鈥檛 know what all the hate is about on this app. It worked perfectly for me and my four friends. We were able to easily unlock and ride bikes and it accurately kept our ride time. The bikes are in much better condition than the bike share program in my city. I will definitely use this service every time I visit Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divvy used to be awesome but Lyft seems to be neglecting it these days. Classic blue bikes falling into disrepair, docks no longer being balanced, and the app has been full of bugs ever since they added scooters. A cynic might suspect they鈥檙e purposely running the bike share service into the ground so that cars are ride sharing looks better in comparison. Lyft step up your game!\n",
      "\n",
      "I love having the access to divvy so close to my house. I do wish the bikes were a little lighter. Going from the bike I own to the divvy bikes I feel like I鈥檓 carrying an extra 30 lbs with me. Also, we need more docks on the lakefront!! We like to bike to the beaches and it鈥檚 nearly impossible to find a dock close and/or with open spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I were using the bikes to get to the train station and we couldn鈥檛 dock one of the bikes. We put it in the holder and it didn鈥檛 turn green we couldn鈥檛 like unlock it to retry docking it. We told the customer service and they said it will go down as missing and that it will continue to run for 24 hours. They said they won鈥檛 charge extra but I doubt it. It鈥檚 a terrible idea to ride the bikes. Would not recommend. BYOB - Bring your own bike! Or Run!\n",
      "\n",
      "Pls read this before you download this app my friends who live in a more predominantly white neighborhood only gets charged 3.30 to use the bike for 30 minutes where as where I live it cost 3.30 to unlock the bike then an xtra .20 cents PER MINUTE now do remind u most areas are a red zone so it forces you to drive to where u go then to drive back which takes more money I had to pay 10$ + for a 10min ride what should鈥檝e been only about 5$\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicago is the absolute worst place to ride a bike. It鈥檚 illegal to ride on the sidewalk, yet there are no bike lanes and everyone is yelling at you or getting in the way. It鈥檚 totally dangerous and your app shouldn鈥檛 be encouraging people to bike around in such a stressful environment. Not to mention the bikes are huge, heavy, and hard to control. If you鈥檙e going to use Divvy ONLY GO on a LEGITIMATE TRAIL near the lake or through one of the parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information on the app is deliberately vague to trick you into spending more on the bikes than you intend to. The information in the app is also inconsistent with the signs on the street. Then when you call customer support to resolve the issue they are impossible to get anything anywhere with. It took me over an hour. As a whole they are not customer service oriented at all, which is unusual in this day and age. I expect more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divvy as a service is great. The app however is a joke. It is nearly impossible to rely on the availability they display as often you will arrive  at a station and none of the bikes/scooters showing as available actually can be used. It鈥檚 pretty pathetic that at this point they can鈥檛 accurately show you what is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "I鈥檝e never wrote a review in my entire life for any industry or anything so when I say I鈥檓 mad I mean it. This app doesn鈥檛 function at all, it deposited my money of course but wouldn鈥檛 allow me to unlock the bike. And what鈥檚 with this 鈥渙ne way鈥?stuff..... MAYBE I want to ride a bike somewhere and come back home without having to dock my bike and re-rent another one. Just awful. If I could give negative stars I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought an annual pass and am waiting for my keycard to arrive in the mail. Supposedly I am able to activate bikes with this app while I wait for the card, but I kept getting error messages. The app also mistakenly believed that bikes were available at the dock closest to my office. The terminal did not recognize the credit card tied to my account. Divvy is unusable until I get my keycard in the mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the past 2 days the maps portion of the app does not update. It doesnt show where bikes are or what bikes are in the station. It has been frozen. My app is up to date and so is my ios. You can still rent divvys just there is no way to tell if a bike on the sidewalk is there or not. It also looks this same in the Lyft app. I am in Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "More stats, even as an option, would be appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd love the option to report issues with a bike: unresponsive braking, gears won't shift, seat issue, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a cool and useful app. I like being able to see the number of available bikes near me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy to use. I appreciate the option to save docks to a favorites list so you can see quickly which have bikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Couldn鈥檛 get the app to process for me to unlock a bike, had to have a friend buy 2 passes so I could ride too. Still got charged for the failed transaction. Emailed customer service and they replied right away, but the entire process was annoying and the bikes aren鈥檛 that great.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I had problems taking off the bike from the dock after I payed for it, and the app didn鈥檛 recognized that I actually wasn鈥檛 able to ride the bike. I wrote them for my problem and had NO response whatsoever. Totally felt robbed. Never gonna use it again ever, dont download it, there are other similar services that are way better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app will show that an edivvy is fully charged, but when I go to unlock it, I get an error that says 鈥減lease use a different bike鈥? This usually happens when I lock up and go into a store and come out to use the same bike.\n",
      "\n",
      "This app never reflects the correct amount of available bikes at a station. It might show 2 bikes available, but those bikes are flagged for maintenance and unable to use. So basically you just have to walk around and see what is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "No way save favorite bike locations...if anyone know how please share.  Divvy staff doesn鈥檛 know how either...two phone calls, one I was supposed to get an email and the other one was told to just 鈥渞eload鈥?the app which I had already done....\n",
      "\n",
      "So so bad.  Worst experience trying to grab two simple bikes.  If something goes wrong with your bike divvy won鈥檛 help and of course wont refund you.  Lost a few bucks than had to Uber.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Heads up.  Would never use Divvy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app should let you type in businesses like in google maps. Then show divvy stations around that business. Also the bikes are unbelievably slow. Like shockingly slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app keeps sending me docks without available bikes. I don鈥檛 think it know the difference between a available and non available bike!\n",
      "\n",
      "So convenient to have in the city! The bikes are very well maintained!\n",
      "\n",
      "The app unlocked the bike seamlessly. Always good when there鈥檚 room to dock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app doesn鈥檛 allow you to rent multiple bikes at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like bikes.\n",

      "Seems all stations I go to never have bikes. What a waste of money...\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased a full day $15 pass off my credit card. I was able to use the code provided to me only once. Every time I docked the bike, I was no longer able to use the code provided and was told to scan the QR code instead. This is where the issue came into play. Apparently, every time I scan with my phone, it was accruing a whole different payment method. So not only was I charged $15 off my credit card, I was also charged $15-16 additional dollars from the app. Needless to say with the $25 hold, my few hours of riding cost me well over $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reached out to customer service. Entering into day 6, I heard nothing else from them regarding my refund, which is why I鈥檓 leaving this review. Know what your doing before renting these bikes. I鈥檒l walk to where I鈥檓 going before ever considering renting from them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divvy is a bike sharing service to get you from point A to point B. The bikes are slow and heavy because they have to be durable enough to withstand all the idiots out there that abuse them. And speaking of idiots, giving the app one star because it doesn鈥檛 have one feature you like such as keeping track of your favorite docks? If you can鈥檛 figure out how to find a dock without that, you probably shouldn鈥檛 be riding a bike in the city. One star for not adequately tracking the calories you burn? Come on. Buy a Fitbit if you want to know that. The purpose of the app is to help you find an available bike nearby and access it using a code, and it works very well at doing that. It runs off the GPS on your phone, so if the location isn鈥檛 accurate, blame your cell service, not the Divvy app. The app is also not responsible for the traffic in Chicago that makes it difficult for you to get around on a bike.  It鈥檚 much easier to get around on a bike than a car in many cases, and much cheaper than Uber.\n",
