But the app constantly has misinformation about number of available docks or bikes.

1,False,2021-07-10 17:57:39,"Absolutely horrible if you want to rely on it as a form of transportation. If you want to take random rides for fun, I guess it’s fine.  Their bikes are insanely heavy and hard to maneuver. The seats are impossible to adjust. The baskets they have are completely useless so you better not have anything that you need to bring with you. The e bikes are kind of good but same basket issue and you can never find them or their batteries are dead. And then there’s the issue of the docks. It’s feast or famine. They either have completely full docks so you can’t lock up the bike you have or there’s no bikes available. I tried using it as my commute to work but the complete lack of dependability on their end meant I was either going to be late or I had to use different transport. And then it’s only financially feasible if you pay for the year which if you only use it occasionally is not worth it. I don’t understand. I’ve used bike shares in other cities and they are leaps and bounds better than divvy. The bikes actually work, they have decent baskets so if you have a bag to tote it’s not a problem, you can actually find the bikes and there’s plenty of docks. Also, be wary of the e bikes because I had a $15 ride recently that was only 5 miles because I happened to be in a higher COL area. Save your money and buy yourself a bike that actually works, take the el, walk, drive. Don’t use divvy.",consumer with a conscience,1,Use any other mode of transportation,
2,False,2022-06-30 02:53:10,"I’ve been a paid annual member for several years and it seems Divvy is been falling by the wayside. The most pressing issue is that the app incorrectly displays availability of classic and e-bikes at ALL Divvy stations. I went to multiple stations: 1) stated on app 3 e-bikes but station was completely empty, 2) another station 5 classic and 2 e-bikes but just had 2 e-bikes marked for repair and then 3) station also had incorrect availability. This appears to be a systemic issue that has last throughout the day even after reporting it. 

Paying annual members should not have to walk 20-30 minutes to multiple stations just to check to see if there is a bike available. What’s the point of having an app if it is completely incorrect.

Lyft also disabled third party access from apps like Transit, even though their contract with the city specifically states they must act in “good faith” with third party developers.

154,False,2018-09-28 15:22:33,"Divvy is a bike sharing service to get you from point A to point B. The bikes are slow and heavy because they have to be durable enough to withstand all the idiots out there that abuse them. And speaking of idiots, giving the app one star because it doesn’t have one feature you like such as keeping track of your favorite docks? If you can’t figure out how to find a dock without that, you probably shouldn’t be riding a bike in the city. One star for not adequately tracking the calories you burn? Come on. Buy a Fitbit if you want to know that. The purpose of the app is to help you find an available bike nearby and access it using a code, and it works very well at doing that. It runs off the GPS on your phone, so if the location isn’t accurate, blame your cell service, not the Divvy app. The app is also not responsible for the traffic in Chicago that makes it difficult for you to get around on a bike.  It’s much easier to get around on a bike than a car in many cases, and much cheaper than Uber.",liquidcourage,5,"Divvy app works great for me, why so many negative reviews?",
155,False,2018-05-29 02:15:43,"Yes, I said it twice.

I registered on the app but the app says incorrect/ email not recognized.

I asked for a discount code and they sent a discount code which expired in December, 2017!

Some of the touch screens in town don’t work. Some of the bikes can’t be taken out of the lock.",AbJain89,1,Broken! Broken!!!,
