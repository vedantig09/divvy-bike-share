0,8/7/21 14:50,"Great concept, bad execution",3,D Hizzle,FALSE,"Great concept, bad execution.I love the idea behind the app, and having public bikes is a great idea I can get behind. But the app constantly has misinformation about number of available docks or bikes. Just the other night I stopped at a station with “2 docks free” only to find every dock filled and bikes just piling up on the side. Incredibly inconvenient to have to ride a mile away from my destination just to walk back after already getting there.",
1,7/10/21 17:57,Use any other mode of transportation,1,consumer with a conscience,FALSE,"Use any other mode of transportation.Absolutely horrible if you want to rely on it as a form of transportation. If you want to take random rides for fun, I guess it’s fine.  Their bikes are insanely heavy and hard to maneuver. The seats are impossible to adjust. The baskets they have are completely useless so you better not have anything that you need to bring with you. The e bikes are kind of good but same basket issue and you can never find them or their batteries are dead. And then there’s the issue of the docks. It’s feast or famine. They either have completely full docks so you can’t lock up the bike you have or there’s no bikes available. I tried using it as my commute to work but the complete lack of dependability on their end meant I was either going to be late or I had to use different transport. And then it’s only financially feasible if you pay for the year which if you only use it occasionally is not worth it. I don’t understand. I’ve used bike shares in other cities and they are leaps and bounds better than divvy. The bikes actually work, they have decent baskets so if you have a bag to tote it’s not a problem, you can actually find the bikes and there’s plenty of docks. Also, be wary of the e bikes because I had a $15 ride recently that was only 5 miles because I happened to be in a higher COL area. Save your money and buy yourself a bike that actually works, take the el, walk, drive. Don’t use divvy.",
2,6/30/22 2:53,App Broken | Availability of Bikes not Synced,1,R-Hays,FALSE,"App Broken | Availability of Bikes not Synced.I’ve been a paid annual member for several years and it seems Divvy is been falling by the wayside. The most pressing issue is that the app incorrectly displays availability of classic and e-bikes at ALL Divvy stations. I went to multiple stations: 1) stated on app 3 e-bikes but station was completely empty, 2) another station 5 classic and 2 e-bikes but just had 2 e-bikes marked for repair and then 3) station also had incorrect availability. This appears to be a systemic issue that has last throughout the day even after reporting it. 

Paying annual members should not have to walk 20-30 minutes to multiple stations just to check to see if there is a bike available. What’s the point of having an app if it is completely incorrect. Considering this is a public/private partnership, I’ll be reaching out to appropriate city officials for resolution and awareness of this issue, which I’m sure breeches contractual agreements. Get your act together Divvy!!!",
3,8/16/20 13:57,Divvy is my key to the city.,5,Ryman2800,FALSE,"Divvy is my key to the city..Last year I signed up for a Divvy for all membership and I was nervous to use it it during the pandemic I started using it and gained confidence to bike all over the city, weather its to a friends miles away or a sunrise or sunset and even grocery shopping. The best things is I don’t need to worry about bike maintenance, it being stolen or lugging it up and down my steps like I would if I had a bike :) At first I didn’t like being limited to 45 minutes and having to check to see if there were bikes in my area and open docks at my destination, but it is not really an inconvenience and the mobility and adventures I have access to void those inconveniences :)",
4,9/9/18 19:51,Ultra condescending customer service,1,djp270,FALSE,"Ultra condescending customer service.I downloaded the app and went to set it up with my info. Apparently you cannot do this. I called to say that when I tried to set up the account it seemed like I could only do it if I signed up for a year. I said I did not want that I just wanted to be able to occasionally use a bike. She said I cannot sign up on line or on the app then. I asked why it says the best way purchase a ride is through the app if you can only use the app if you are signed up with an annual membership. I said I think I am missing something because an annual membership we make purchasing a single ride unnecessary.  I was really trying to understand what I was missing.  I left the phone call still confused, and blown away by how condescending the woman I spoke to was. I am still not sure what the purpose of this app is.",
5,9/16/20 17:23,Recent update locked me out,1,aherstein,FALSE,"Recent update locked me out.Divvy updated their backend *again* and had to recover my account a second time. This time it could not find my account and never send the verification email. Divvy has been going downhill every since Lyft started operating the service; it’s clear they want to kneecap the service to get more people to use their ride hailing product

Lyft also disabled third party access from apps like Transit, even though their contract with the city specifically states they must act in “good faith” with third party developers. Look up the history on this; they did the same thing to CitiBike in New York. Lyft is a scum company that has no interest in improving bike travel in the city. They only care about profits and keeping users within their walled garden Lyft app",
6,6/25/20 17:15,Lyft + Divvy made both apps useless,1,ByeDivvy,FALSE,Lyft + Divvy made both apps useless.After Lyft and divvy integrated I was u able to use either apps. It is now June and I have been trying to resolve this issue since APRIL!!! Customer service has been completely useless in resolving this issue: the first point of contact is unable to resolve it and has to escalate it to their supervisor (who only they can contact via email). After calling numerous times EACH supervisor has responded with the same copy and paste response (although  I specifically asked the first point of contact to note that it’s not the case—- which obviously means they don’t read all of the notes written). As much as I loved using divvy — my relationship with the company will now have to end due to their incompetent customer service.,
7,9/1/22 21:05,bikes are a scam,1,Jddisnucpssidudjf,FALSE,"bikes are a scam.i’ve gone and walked to three different stations to just get a classic bike. there were multiple at each station but no matter what the bikes were “unavailable”. with no reason or ANYTHING. every single station wouldn’t allow me to get a classic bike. but of course, all the more expensive electric bikes are available. there’s no good way to contact customer service and im starting to think the classic bikes are unavailable because they’re trying to get people to use the electric bikes which would thus give divvy more money. upsetting that i’ve walked like thirty minutes to find a CLASSIC BIKE and was unsuccessful. definitely don’t think i’ll try divvy again after this happening for the millionth time.",
8,5/30/19 21:34,Poor design.  Customer service lies.,2,________David__________,FALSE,"Poor design.  Customer service lies..I had the need to use a bike in chicago last weekend.  Somehow ended up getting charged for three rides.  App history shows one ride that went over 30 min.  So, a second ride charge was warranted. When I questioned the third ride, customer service said they would graciously refund the third charge as a “one time courtesy”.  While I appreciated that, I pressed the rep as to what the third charge was for.  She then told me it appeared I had 3 bikes out at the same time.  Pretty hard to do (or even corroborate given my account history that shows a single ride) with one person riding.  

She either lied or their back-end data is in accurate.  

I’m giving the app a 2star rating as I’ve yet to find a way to see purchase history, credits purchased, or credits available for future use. 

Suggest using app for nothing more than locating stations with bike availability - use the pay kiosks with a card when ready to purchase.",
9,12/27/18 21:59,Mostly good app,4,a_m_s_c_c,FALSE,"Mostly good app.The app is pretty good but for 2 complaints:
- if a bike is “dead” (red light on) it still appears to count as available. So you might walk to a station that has 4 bikes only to find that all 4 of them are unusable 
- at one point my account was suspended simply because of an expired credit card and I wasn’t able to do anything through the app to fix it. Not to mention I received no email warning that my account was about to be suspended",

This time, the DIVVY app worked great for scanning a bike.  The standard bikes are heavy but easy to use.  I’m glad you can have them for 3 hrs without returning.

The ebikes were extra $ but well worth it.  All in all the app made for a seamless experience.",

It’s nice to do door to door routing using Divvy, and even better to allow one time use tokens in case I didn’t bring my fob.

12,7/22/18 17:47,Favorite Stations,2,Maggi Suppe,FALSE,"Favorite Stations.I still can’t understand why the favorite stations feature was removed and never re-instated.  It helped frequent users quickly determine if they could go to their usual bike stations or head elsewhere if the racks were full/empty. I would think that Divvy would want to capture data on favorite stations.  If a station was flagged as a favorite by many users, but it was continually full/empty, that may indicate the need for valet services or simply more rack space.",
13,5/25/20 15:46,Where’s the Apple Watch app?,5,liea,FALSE,"Where’s the Apple Watch app?.I haven’t had any hiccups with the iPhone app. Works just as intended. The Divvy system is easy to use. But, please please make an Apple Watch app. It would be nice to Divvy to a location, return bike to a local dock, and then run around in the area. I don’t like running with my phone, especially when running gear doesn’t have the pockets for it.",
14,4/1/20 16:29,Update fail,1,Eek 134,FALSE,"Update fail.So, divvy apparently is lyft now. And apparently the geniuses behind this world class company (*not*) from the bowels of Silicon Valley forgot about the simple issue of account integration... because how could anyone have had a divvy account and a lyft account with different email addresses and contact info?!? What a wild world we live in!? So, now it’s impossible to sign into this app...

Please fix it, like yesterday. Not sure if you found these developers from Trump’s COVID response team or what, but the continued failure of Americans to rise to challenges (or a simple app upgrade) is incredibly disappointing.",
15,7/6/19 19:12,Weekend Visitor,5,Ry guy 69,FALSE,Weekend Visitor.I don’t know what all the hate is about on this app. It worked perfectly for me and my four friends. We were able to easily unlock and ride bikes and it accurately kept our ride time. The bikes are in much better condition than the bike share program in my city. I will definitely use this service every time I visit Chicago.,
16,7/11/19 23:26,"poor migration from old app, poor UX for account management in the new one",1,Chicago PM,FALSE,"poor migration from old app, poor UX for account management in the new one.With the migration to the new app divvy logged me (everyone?) out. Awesome surprise to find out on my commute to work. 

I didn’t remember which email I used form my account and turns out I had 2 accounts for different years I’ve used divvy memberships.
I originally logged in to the new app using my expired account - which doesn’t have an active membership so that’s on me.

BUT ... I couldn’t figure out how log out to sign in with a different email.  This app doesn’t follow standard patterns like clicking on your avatar.  I deleted the app twice and reinstalled but it remembered my login.  After giving up and getting an Uber, I found the option -  it’s hidden in lightweight barely readable text on a secondary screen.

Release management matters - wish I had more of a heads up and less friction with the upgrade.",
17,10/14/18 2:02,The importance of Feedback,4,ReneeKIR,FALSE,"The importance of Feedback.The app is simple to use and the updates make it better . For the developer, it’s important to leave feedback on those comments that are concerning just as if they were praises. You won’t ever get better if you choice to ignore it.

Chatted with help desk. Said to use kiosk.  Did but wasted time on first bike doing all this.  Different prices charged for app rental vs kiosk rental and those prices were not what was advertised on kiosk.  Charged twice as much as we expected.  Called customer service and the guy literally laughed when I expressed frustration about pricing misinformation and differences.  Will delete app once I post review.  Terrible all the way around.,

Classic blue bikes falling into disrepair, docks no longer being balanced, and the app has been full of bugs ever since they added scooters. A cynic might suspect they’re purposely running the bike share service into the ground so that cars are ride sharing looks better in comparison. Lyft step up your game!",

I complained to customer service many times. All I got were hollow apologies and “sorry we can’t guarantee a bike every time”. The only thing they offered to do was to end my subscription early with no refund, which was insulting. 

If you want to pay money to a company for nothing in return, get Divvy. Otherwise don’t waste your time.",

Going from the bike I own to the divvy bikes I feel like I’m carrying an extra 30 lbs with me. Also, we need more docks on the lakefront!!

We told the customer service and they said it will go down as missing and that it will continue to run for 24 hours. They said they won’t charge extra but I doubt it.

-Simple Apple Watch app would be great for generating codes at the nearest station without having to take phone out

It merges your Lyft account with your Divvy account, and fails to credit you for the membership you paid for. 
It just killed the service without notice for weeks last Summer. 
Customer service is worse than useless. 
The app is optimized to maximize profit, and minimize functionality. 
Lyft took over Divvy to kill the competition from bike shares, providing such dreadful service that frustrated riders give up and take a Lyft. 
But this company just doesn’t care that its service is dangerous and dysfunctional because it has a monopoly, and makes money no matter how terrible the service.",

If there were bikes in the dock when I looked, I’d unlock one with my physical keyfob and ride; if not, I wouldn’t! This app is quite an improvement since then, and I use Divvy much more, being able to plan around availability.  

I’m pleased that the odd map scrolling bug in the 14.39.42 update was fixed quickly. That made the app really hard to use.  

As for app problems, there are sometimes little glitches such as an e-bike showing on the map when it’s actually nowhere to be seen, or inaccurate counts of available bikes at a dock. But for the most part it works as it should.  

I haven’t noticed very many payment oddities, even since the Lyft buyout. A few times recently the app has had trouble authorizing with Apple Pay, but it clears up after a while, and I’m not sure which party is to blame.

154,9/28/18 15:22,"Divvy app works great for me, why so many negative reviews?",5,liquidcourage,FALSE,"Divvy app works great for me, why so many negative reviews?.Divvy is a bike sharing service to get you from point A to point B. The bikes are slow and heavy because they have to be durable enough to withstand all the idiots out there that abuse them. And speaking of idiots, giving the app one star because it doesn’t have one feature you like such as keeping track of your favorite docks? If you can’t figure out how to find a dock without that, you probably shouldn’t be riding a bike in the city. One star for not adequately tracking the calories you burn? Come on. Buy a Fitbit if you want to know that. The purpose of the app is to help you find an available bike nearby and access it using a code, and it works very well at doing that. It runs off the GPS on your phone, so if the location isn’t accurate, blame your cell service, not the Divvy app. The app is also not responsible for the traffic in Chicago that makes it difficult for you to get around on a bike.  It’s much easier to get around on a bike than a car in many cases, and much cheaper than Uber.",

I registered on the app but the app says incorrect/ email not recognized.

I asked for a discount code and they sent a discount code which expired in December, 2017!

Some of the touch screens in town don’t work. Some of the bikes can’t be taken out of the lock.",
