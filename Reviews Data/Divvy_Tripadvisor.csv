Ana Ri,"Porto Alegre, RS",14,1,horrible experience with divvy bikes,Oct 2022 ,11-Nov-22,"horrible experience with divvy bikes.when I returned the bike, it locked as it should, but didn't stop counting the time. I activated the help of the app and after sending many photos and explanations, the person who was attending said that the tour had ended and I would not be charged extra. However, I was charged 100 dollars for a one-hour tour. After a lot of explaining and stress on my part, I ended up wasting part of my short time in Chicago to resolve the issue. They returned part of the money, but still warned that the 100 dollars would be returned within 7 days. 7 days!!",
ManyBusyTrips,"Frankfort, IL",18,1,Fraudulent charges,Oct 2022 ,21-Oct-22,Fraudulent charges.Fraudulent charges after bike was returned appropriately. Ended up getting charged $400 because of their error and no one will help remedy the situation! The customer service is an absolute joke! Do not trust this service at all. too bad we cannot leave zero stars.,
Donya E,"Lisbon, Portugal",83,1,Are care when using their bikes,Oct 2022 ,1-Oct-22,Are care when using their bikes.A rip off. I used the app and ended up paying 15dollars for a 30 minute ride. Then 3 dollars for a 3 minute ride. My husband used his credit card no still doesnt khow much he paid! Be very careful with this service. It seems that they are connected to partners like LYFT who ……if you are a LYFT subscriber then LYFT charges you a lot.,
Danione W,NA,1,1,Fraud,Sep 2022 ,29-Sep-22,"Fraud.we rented some bikes after returning them correctly at the station, they charged us 300 dollars for a failure of the station itself. a fraud do not use those bicycles",
markhayw00d,"Wolverhampton, UK",1,1,Misleading and charge what they want,Sep 2022 ,25-Sep-22,"Misleading and charge what they want.Myself and my wife booked a $15 day pass. The description was 3 hour classic rides to be used over 24 hours.

As we booked on and off various bikes we received emails with quite significant charges on top of the $15. As the app said pass applied we assumed the flat rate would supersede these additional charges.

I emailed Lyft bikes and scooter who had emailed these charges and was advised the $15 day pass didn’t cover electric bikes. FrAnkly we didn’t know the difference between electric bikes or non electric bikes. Does’classic rides’ mean non electric bikes?? Apparently so!!

Very misleading and deliberately fraudulent. Avoid and just walk or take an Uber!!

Sabrina S,NA,1,1,They try to rip off people hoping they will not notice!!,Aug 2022 ,21-Sep-22,"They try to rip off people hoping they will not notice!!.The last 3 times we rented a bike under 30 minutes we got charged random amounts every single time.
1st time: $10.99
2nd time: $8.99
3rd time: $22.15

I received all of them back after complaining but want everyone else to know that you should check your credit card after renting a bike with them. I cannot imagine how many people alrady got charged random amounts and did not notice! If I did not check my I already would have been charged $45.13 for no reason!!!
What a rip off!!!",

I was called to a federal wildfire and they charged me for a bike that was returned to their equipment. Bike was returned less than 30 minutes, due to the $2 rental for 30 min. Rented bikes many times from Lyft, now when I'm out fighting fires they decide to pull this. Charged $272.50 twice for their equipment improperly working",

Not worth the risk to rent these bikes and their customer service is rude.,
Andy W,NA,1,1,Bad,Jul 2022 ,7-Jul-22,Bad.They don’t have bikes in the stations but they have piles of them locked up not in stations. Management doesn’t respond to the lack of bikes and the employees are not in power to solve the problem,
Dc,NA,1,3,My Aching Back,May 2022 ,18-May-22,"My Aching Back.The idea of bike sharing is great. I have actually enjoyed having the convenience of the bikes since I don't own a car. But as with most ambitious apps there are a lot of things they did not consider. One of which is the amount of stealing that goes on and abuse of the app. My main concern however is the awful quality of the bikes. The original blue bikes are useless. Most of them are in horrible disrepair and the fact that these bikes get left outside all year round only contributes to that. Then you have the original ebikes, the black ones, which at first were okay but now many of them are unresponsive and also in disrepair. The bikes are very heavy and have absolutely no suspension in the seat or the bike itself. I came to realize that riding them actually aggravates my sciatica. Last year when I was riding the ebikes on a regular basis I ended up with a severe sciatica attack that had me immobilized over a week. I thought the new bikes, the light colored ones were going to be better but they are just as bad as far as the suspension. So if you are young and have no back problems perhaps you will fare well.

I do have to say that the pricing is great because if you are on any type of assistance such as snap or Medicaid you can join divvy for all and get them at a great price.",
Oks,NA,1,2,"Used to be great, now AWFUL :(",May 2022 ,11-May-22,"Used to be great, now AWFUL :(.It used to be a really nice bike sharing service. But not any more. Yesterday I opened my Divvy app and saw that they rapidly changed their policy without even bothering to inform their customers about new fees.

They introduced fees for electric bikes that used to be free of charge in half of the city (in so-called green zones, areas where there’s not enough divvy parking spaces). They say they did it because they now have PAID electric scooters (they only offer a slight discount for those who already paid for annual divvy membership), which doesn’t make any sense. Dear Divvy, if I wanted paid scooters instead of free bikes, I would have gotten myself a different membership!

I live in university area. Now ALL divvy stations around me either have no bikes at all or have no empty parking slots depending on the university classes schedule.

If you aren’t a Divvy member already, don’t become one. They’re not worth it any more. You can buy a decent used bike for about the same price as they charge for annual membership and spare yourself from all the inconveniences that now come with divvy.",
wrightm00dy,"York, UK",16,1,Setting up account is hard,Nov 2021 ,17-Nov-21,"Setting up account is hard.My husband and I wanted to hire bikes and we were unable to set up an account or pay by card as it didn’t recognise a UK post code (zip code) or a UK mobile phone number. We just kept getting error messages.

We was disappointed as we was looking forward to doing our own bike tour",
Tiler C,NA,1,1,Is Divvy/Lyft a scam?,Aug 2021 ,19-Aug-21,"Is Divvy/Lyft a scam?.Divvy/Lyft has stolen from me. I’m getting a huge feeling of scam-like energy happening here: I rented out a bike utilizing the app & used it for less than an hour before returning it, securely. the green light came on and it beeped, which means it’s LOCKED IN. Two days later, Lyft emails me exclaiming that the bike is considered lost or stolen, and if I do not return to ensure the bike is stationed there(I’m not from Chicago), I would receive a charge of 1200 dollars on my debit card. I had already been charged twice over 110 dollars (not sure why twice?) because the bike wasn’t considered returned. .15 cents per minute, which haulted after 24 hours. Another important detail is i opted for using the 15 dollar 24 hour rental option in the app. So why was I charged that much? Ultimately, now I have paid around 450 dollars (they take it automatically) for a bike rental that I used for less than ONE HOUR. Conveniently, they claimed they gave me a deal since my account has been in good standing, and charged me 250 for the missing bike, rather than 1200. There are more details, but it feels too complex now. I am not the one to get on here and write a review like this.. but this sucks bad. I saw at least 5 divvy bikes lying around the bike trail that were abandoned… if i go and collect/ return those, can I at least get my money back? Damn. There needs to be trackers on the bikes, and perhaps cameras at the stations. But again, I locked my bike in securely. I’ve used Divvy for years. Shame.",
Wayne W,NA,1,1,$103 for less than ten minutes!,Jul 2021 ,21-Jul-21,"$103 for less than ten minutes!.I got charged $103 for a five minute ride in a broken bike. I returned it to a station less than a mile away and it locked into place. The next day I got billed $103 for 612 minutes. They only have email customer support, no options for billing disputes and I got a canned useless email back from them. The bike had a broken seat collar that collapsed on me while riding it. I feel and broke a rib to it seems. Don’t do DIVVY!",
Angelo G,NA,1,1,Money Mistake,Jul 2021 ,18-Jul-21,"Money Mistake.I was on the bikes last night with some friends and was charged $114 dollars to ride the bikes. We were only on the bikes for 24 minutes, how do I get my money back?",
Matt s,"Chicago, IL",1,1,It’s up with Divvy they took 57 $ then 275 and tried to justify it,Jun 2021 ,12-Jul-21,"It’s up with Divvy they took 57 $ then 275 and tried to justify it.This was the worst bike ride ever. I rode the bike Couse I was drunk, called and talked to a operator who told my ride ended. She assured me, then the next day o see a 57 doller charge on my account . I call and say what’s going on.

A diffrent operator comes on , says your bike wasn’t docked we charged you 57 dollers for it. Couple days later they hit me with another charge for 275 saying the bike was never docked. Not keep in mind they just charged me 57 so not that 57 plus 275. In the past two weeks , I haven’t eating knor slept . I’ve had to steal food and the water I drink had so much led in it I taste metal. They took my money and it wasn’t theirs to begin with . Thank divvy for help me become a statistic and criminal .. thank you

If you read this review yo every divvy bike you see brake it please",
Yvonne M,NA,1,3,I works fine until it doesn't,Jul 2021 ,6-Jul-21,"I works fine until it doesn't.When something goes wrong, there's no recourse. I've had a yearly subscription for about 2 years. Lately l have had frequent issues with my key fob not working. When my key doesn't work, I usually try the app and so customer service invariably tells me that my app must not be up to date. At least once I was specifically told my key didn't work because my app was out of date. Today after getting stranded in 87° temps and no help but the usual from CS, I asked why the operation of my key which is connected to all the necessary things that identify me, including my credit card on file, would be subject to an app, which is frankly always out of date. I pressed the issue, and the typical CS story changed. Now I'm told there is no connection between the functioning of the key fob and the app. I think CS is instructed to blaim your version of the app as a pat explanation. Meanwhile, there is really no help when you're out there and need to get home. There is also no compensation for a service you've paid for being denied. So the upshot, is that Divvy works just fine until it doesn't. Do not rely on it.",
Layy Lanii,NA,1,1,PLEASE DONT GET RIPPED OFF,Jun 2021 ,27-Jun-21,PLEASE DONT GET RIPPED OFF.Me and my husband thought it would be nice to get the bikes and ride around and they WERE SUPPOSED TO CHARGE 3 Dollars for each bike w a 25$ Hold THESE PEOPLE CHARGED 68.00 in Total and after 24 Hours still didn’t give us Our Money Back then I look up and see all these claims and it Makes me think THEY ARE JUST A BIG SCAM,
Carie-Anne S,NA,4,2,Website is a lie,Jun 2021 ,13-Jun-21,"Website is a lie.VISITORS BEWARE! E-bikes cost much more than just $15 for a day pass. Even though the website doesn't tell you this, I had to learn the hard way. Apparently you're supposed to just know this information, or be willing to read the entire website, even though you're from out of town and just looking for a fun way to spend a few hours on a Saturday. The cost is actually $15 for a day pass, PLUS .20 cents PER MILE on an e-bike. Based on reading the webpage, you would think it was only $15 as long as you had the bike checked out for less than 3 hours. That's what the webpage says. But the webpage doesn't tell you the whole truth. Just avoid this altogether. We had a good time riding around the park areas of Chicago, but in hindsight, it wasn't really worth the hassle of feeling taken advantage of by this company.",
Kurtosis_81,"Perth, Australia",2,1,Over charged twice,Jun 2021 ,13-Jun-21,"Over charged twice.10 minute ride from, Andersonville to Wrigley Field and then same time frame back. Charged for 144 minutes each way. Docked bikes, couldnt remove. The over charge both way cost me $145. Submitted claim, will see if they do anything. Bollucs if not, very disappointed.",
Chicago 2021 Trip,"Covington, KY",1,1,Horrible,Jun 2021 ,10-Jun-21,Horrible.DO NOT RIDE DIVVY!! They will not respond to your reports and charge you $109.30 if you cannot dock your bike a docking station. Even if the docking station is full and all surrounding are at capacity. Customer support will suggest you returning to Chicago finding the bike and docking... not a helpful solution when you're a visitor!,
Brandi B,NA,5,1,Didn't even leave station,Mar 2021 ,1-Apr-21,"Didn't even leave station.Need more explicit instructions on rental procedures. Downloaded and used the app on my phone to rent bike for three people. Wasn't super user friendly and once we got first bike unlocked, it wouldn't allow us to add any others. Finally gave up and used quiosk for other two bikes and so did my friend who also wanted to rent 3 bikes. She rented hers, but had difficult time because code given didn't unlock black electric bikes, only blue ones. Nothing we saw said anything about difference in renting process nor fees for different bikes. She finally unlocked her 3 and we still had my one and the 30 minutes on that bike was about up, when I got code for two more. Got one out that was blue, but all other bikes at station were black. Tried code for each one and nothing. Only gives you 5 minutes to unlock all bikes you rent too, so was running out of time. Finally called customer service and was told could only do 1 bike from app per account and those were black electric ones. When explained situation about no more blue bikes was told would have to cancel rental and go to another station. Then a man came to add more blue bikes to station and I asked if our code could be reactivated but was told would have to cancel order and do again. Decided to just cancel all bikes so called back customer service. Was about to get charged for 30 minutes from app rental, but I complained enough to get refund. Was told that would take 5 days though. It didn't, but just imagine! Arghhhh! Tried to cancel other two rentals and nothing came up on my account. Was told that as soon as bike is released, card is charged. Customer service questioned my info as if I didn't know my own deets, that by way we're same from app rental that did show up. Finally handed phone to friend to cancel her bikes and then had to ask (not offered) a reference number in case I get charged for the two from quiosk rental. I see so many people riding these, and wonder how many others have had similar struggles. Even as I was on phone, a group came up to do same as us and so we informed them of process so they wouldn't have same issue. But they at least had a full rack of blue bikes, so it wouldn't have been as big a struggle.",
Tdt,NA,1,4,Only A Downtown Bike,Mar 2021 ,27-Mar-21,"Only A Downtown Bike.I have rented this bike at a Station in my Community for errands! The positive is that. I was able to get the things I needed. The negative is that it's not a long distance bike because in my case it's took over 2 hours to finish my errands and return it to the station. This bike does move slow unless you petal hard The price is very right in renting this bike which makes great sense. The only problems are that Supermarkets won't allow the bike inside and worries about it being stolen. I have to watch watch my back every time I ride this bike to make sure nobody knocks me off it. When I returned it there were problems locking it. I had to e-mail the Office to let them know and the fixed it right away! You do have to leave a $25 deposit which takes 2-3 days to get refunded to your bank account! Overall this bike does get you around but in a slower way which is better than riding a Bus with COVID going on! I""'ll keep using this bike if I have to but it's only good for touring. One thing I do get great exercise riding this bike. I do get a slight workout burn in legs while pushing the petals maybe because I haven't rode a bike in a very long time.",

TravelinMitch,"Chicago, IL",48,1,Poor,Sep 2020 ,25-Sep-20,"Poor.They do a lousy job of transporting bikes to and from where they're needed. The station at my destination for today has no open docks, so I can't use Divvy to get there. Also, I biked to a station just to find out that it had been removed. When I called Divvy from there to ask for the nearest other station, the agent rattled off some locations that were nowhere near where I was. No wonder: the guy said he was in New York -and apparently he had no familiarity w/ Chicago.",

JDL,NA,1,1,Don't Trust Divvy w Your Credit Card,Sep 2020 ,11-Sep-20,"Don't Trust Divvy w Your Credit Card.An unauthorized charge appeared on my card weeks after my last rental. The charge was an odd, large amount (not a mistaken rental charge). Since I hadn't lost my card and my last rental docked properly I had no idea what the charge was for. The only thing I could conclude was that the charge was placed internally by Divvy. Unsettling. And yet, zero response to my complaints about this from Divvy. No explanation. Beware. DON'T TRUST DIVVY W YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!",
Chase W,NA,2,1,Bad Policies,Sep 2020 ,8-Sep-20,Bad Policies.Not charge people 153 dollars and hold it for 5-7 days. I’ve been waiting on this charge to go back into my account and it’s so annoying,
Chloe P,NA,1,1,Awful. Will never use again,Sep 2020 ,8-Sep-20,"Awful. Will never use again.If I could give zero stars I would. Do not use this company, it’s not worth it for the pain they’ll put you (and your wallet) through. I docked a bike after a 10 minute ride and it was not registered but the bike locked and I couldn’t get it out to retry. I immediately raised an incident and included pictures of the bike securely docked at the station. 24 hours later and I have not heard a response from their customer service since the incredibly unhelpful initial response to turn app notifications on (what? How does that relate to my issue?) current bike ride time is over 24 hours with no end to this disaster in sight. And every second you have the bike over 30 minutes is an extra charge.
As I said above, do not use this company. It may be fine but there’s a very very good chance that it isn’t and you’ll be paying for it, trust me. I will never use them again.",
lahanson,"Lake Benton, MN",404,5,Perfect way to see Chicago,Sep 2019 ,30-Dec-19,Perfect way to see Chicago.Some friends and I were in Chicago for a weekend. We wanted to explore the shore of Lake Michigan so we rented some Divvy bikes for an hour. That was fabulous! We picked them up and road along the lake front and got to see boats coming in and out of port. It was great. When we were done it was a little more challenging finding a place to return the bikes to. I had to download the app and then found a location that had 4 empty spaces. Tip: download the app before you start! They were so easy to ride and really fun with a little bell on them!!!,
